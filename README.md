# harry-potter-hangman
A Harry Potter themed Hangman game using JavaScript

This application is based on the traditional Hangman game. The project highlights the ability to dynamically update HTML using JavaScript.

### Other features to note:
  The letters 'appear' once guessed, with all multiples of a single guessed letter appearing simultaneously.
  The words are chosen at random.
  The random words are linked to a photo clue.
  The game is currently set to hardWords mode (this can be changed by switching the code in the game.js file).

### How to Play
Press any key to start guessing the words associated with the displayed picture.
You can only guess a letter once during the round (all multiples of the letter guessed will display).
Wins are tracked, losses are not.
The next word automatically appears once the round has been won or lost.
